# devfest2022
Team DevOps2025's submission for Columbia University's DevFest '22 Hackathon

Team Members: Griffin Newbold and Gabriel Trigo

How To Use:
Launch Application and enter the minimum and maximum values of N to test your code snippet against
Then upload your python file, the filename can be whatever you desire but the code to analyze must 
be encased in a function as follows:

def inputFunction(N):
   #whatever code you wish to run

Once your python file is uploaded give the application a few seconds and out will come a graph detailing
all the traditional runtimes studied in Algorithms classes and then the data points that were generated
To the right hand side will be an analysis of the r-coefficient and the value that is closest will be
given at the bottom as the order of magnitude for the program.
